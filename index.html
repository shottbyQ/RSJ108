Make your own step-by-step guide
================================

This template allows you to build a more advanced step-by-step guide.
The example theme here is for you to change as much as you like to
create appearance and content which are truly your own.

READ THROUGH THE COMMENTS. This is a comment. Everything inside of
this for HTML or '/*' for CSS, is not processed as code, but
instead are just text comments about the code. For this project, the
comments will give you instructions, hints and guides to completing
the project, so skim down through the comments to get an understanding
of what you are being asked to do.

GET ORIENTED IN THE CODE. HTML is made up of tags that look like
this <p> </p>. The tags tell you something about the information
contained between them. Click on the tags in the code on this side
of the editor to get a description of what each tag is for.

IN THIS CHALLENGE, YOU WILL LEARN ABOUT:

- HTML: Nested lists
- HTML: Unordered list
- HTML: Captions
- CSS: Borders
- CSS: Embedding images and videos

              <h3>Be aware of the low pay of a travel writer.</h3>
              <p>You may have fantasies of being sent around the world on assignments with a big commission, all your expenses paid, and endless days people watching in a European cafe. In fact, very few publications pay a travel writer’s expenses, especially if the travel writer is a freelancer and not a staff member for the publication.
Many travel writers work for themselves as freelancers and work contract by contract, story by story. This means you may not have a steady income from travel writing and it can be difficult to make a high income when you are commissioned to write for a publication.
Currently, rates for a 500-word article can range from $10 to $1,000. Often, seasoned writers with years of experience writing for big print publications will earn the higher end of the spectrum for one article. Many travel writers do not earn more than $25 - $300 an article. If you are able to land a big feature or a cover story, you will be paid more. However, it can be difficult to land the more lucrative stories and you will often have to write many articles on a regular basis to support yourself financially in this career.</p>

              <h3>Understand the difficulty of finding a full time position.</h3>
              <p>Landing a full time job as a travel writer for a major travel publication requires years of experience and can be hard to come by even when you do build up a solid reputation in the industry. Many print publications are cutting back on staff as writing moves to online platforms.
Instead, you will need to be willing to freelance as a writer as you build up your portfolio. This means you will have to pitch articles to multiple publications on a consistent basis and write many articles for very little pay, perhaps for several years. As a freelancer, you will also need to arrange your own travel accommodations, your itinerary and spend several days traveling on your own.
To make travel writing your full time job, you will need to build up contacts and credentials in the industry. This can take several years of working from contract to contract until you make a name for yourself. Many travel writers work other, more sustainable jobs while they travel write on the side.</p>

            <div class="content">
              <h3>Remember the benefits of being a travel writer.</h3>
              <p>With the low pay and unstable job security, it can be daunting to pursue a career in travel writing. But many travel writers take on this career because it allows them to experience places they have never seen before and to meet people they would have never met if they were not writing a story about a certain place or area. Often, travel writers are very passionate about their jobs and enjoy the sense of adventure and excitement that their career offers.
It’s important that you are a curious and perceptive traveller who is comfortable roughing it when you have to. You should also be willing to pitch your ideas to an editor and be prepared to promote your work whenever possible. As a beginning travel writer, you will need to showcase writing talent and a zest for adventure, as well as an ability to sell your ideas and writing to editors.</p>

              <h3>Read texts by successful travel writers in several genres.</h3>
              <p>Today, travel writing is much more than publishing articles in a magazine or in a newspaper. Writers are publishing articles on blogs, online magazines, and other online platforms. Successful travel writers have found a certain niche, or angle, and ran with it, using their unique perspective to keep readers engaged and sell stories to editors</p>

            <div class="content">
              <h3>Look at well regarded travel magazines.</h3>
              <p>To get a better sense of the print market, read as many issues as possible of well regarded travel publications and note what types of articles are being published in these magazines. You may look at major travel publications like National Geographic, Travel and Leisure, Afar, and International Living. These are the big publications that can take years to break into and often they are some of the more high paying writing jobs.
You may find a travel magazine that you enjoy and want to write for, or have a specific magazine in mind. Reading the publication before you pitch an article idea will also allow you to customize the pitch letter based on the tone and style of the publication. This could help your pitch to get noticed by the editor, as editors often pay more attention to a pitch that relates to the mandate of their publication.</p>
